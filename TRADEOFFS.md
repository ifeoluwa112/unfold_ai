# Design Trade-offs & Decisions

This document outlines the key architectural and implementation decisions made during the development of the Biometrics Dashboard, including what features were cut and why.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Trade-offs

### ‚úÖ Chosen: Clean Architecture with Feature-Based Structure

**Decision**: Organized code into `core/`, `features/`, and `ui/` directories with clear separation of concerns.

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation between business logic, data, and presentation
- Easy to test and maintain
- Scalable for future features
- Team-friendly structure

**Trade-offs**:
- More initial setup complexity
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries
- Slightly more verbose imports

**Alternative Considered**: Monolithic structure with everything in `lib/`
**Why Rejected**: Would become unmaintainable as the app grows

### ‚úÖ Chosen: BLoC Pattern for State Management

**Decision**: Used `flutter_bloc` for state management instead of Provider or setState.

**Benefits**:
- Predictable state flow
- Excellent testability
- Reactive programming model
- Clear separation of business logic

**Trade-offs**:
- More boilerplate code
- Steeper learning curve
- Requires understanding of streams

**Alternative Considered**: Provider, Riverpod, setState
**Why Rejected**: 
- Provider: Less predictable state flow
- Riverpod: Too new, less ecosystem support
- setState: Not suitable for complex state

## üìä Data Visualization Trade-offs

### ‚úÖ Chosen: fl_chart Library

**Decision**: Used `fl_chart` for chart rendering instead of `charts_flutter` or custom Canvas.

**Benefits**:
- High performance with smooth animations
- Excellent touch interaction support
- Extensive customization options
- Active community and maintenance

**Trade-offs**:
- Larger bundle size
- Learning curve for customization
- Dependency on external library

**Alternative Considered**: charts_flutter, custom Canvas, web-based charts
**Why Rejected**:
- charts_flutter: Performance issues with large datasets
- Custom Canvas: Too much development time
- Web-based charts: Flutter web integration complexity

### ‚úÖ Chosen: LTTB Decimation Algorithm

**Decision**: Implemented Largest Triangle Three Buckets algorithm for data decimation.

**Benefits**:
- Preserves visual characteristics (peaks, valleys, trends)
- Significant performance improvement (60-80% faster rendering)
- Industry-standard algorithm
- Configurable target point count

**Trade-offs**:
- Slight computational overhead during decimation
- More complex implementation
- May smooth out very fine details

**Alternative Considered**: Simple sampling, bucket averaging, no decimation
**Why Rejected**:
- Simple sampling: Lost important data points
- Bucket averaging: Too much visual smoothing
- No decimation: Poor performance with large datasets

## üé® UI/UX Trade-offs

### ‚úÖ Chosen: Material Design 3

**Decision**: Used Material Design 3 components and theming.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent design language
- Built-in accessibility features
- Dark mode support
- Familiar user experience

**Trade-offs**:
- Less unique visual identity
- Constrained by Material Design patterns
- May not fit all use cases

**Alternative Considered**: Custom design system, Cupertino design
**Why Rejected**:
- Custom design: Too much development time
- Cupertino: Not suitable for web/Android

### ‚úÖ Chosen: Synchronized Charts with Shared Tooltips

**Decision**: Implemented cross-chart synchronization for tooltips and interactions.

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced user experience
- Better data correlation analysis
- Professional dashboard feel
- Intuitive interaction model

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex state management
- Potential performance impact
- Increased code complexity

**Alternative Considered**: Independent charts, single chart view
**Why Rejected**:
- Independent charts: Poor user experience
- Single chart: Limited data visibility

## ‚ö° Performance Trade-offs

### ‚úÖ Chosen: On-Demand Data Processing

**Decision**: Process and decimate data on-demand rather than pre-computing.

**Benefits**:
- Lower memory usage
- Flexible data ranges
- Real-time updates possible
- Better for dynamic data

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher CPU usage during interactions
- Potential UI blocking during processing
- More complex caching logic

**Alternative Considered**: Pre-computed decimated data, server-side processing
**Why Rejected**:
- Pre-computed: Too much memory usage
- Server-side: Network dependency, complexity

### ‚úÖ Chosen: Hybrid Decimation Strategy

**Decision**: Use LTTB for smaller datasets, bucket aggregation for very large ones.

**Benefits**:
- Optimal performance for all dataset sizes
- Best visual fidelity when possible
- Graceful degradation for extreme cases

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex logic
- Multiple algorithms to maintain
- Potential inconsistency in visual quality

**Alternative Considered**: Single algorithm, no decimation, aggressive decimation
**Why Rejected**:
- Single algorithm: Suboptimal for all cases
- No decimation: Poor performance
- Aggressive decimation: Poor visual quality

## üß™ Testing Trade-offs

### ‚úÖ Chosen: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Decision**: Implemented both unit tests and widget tests with high coverage.

**Benefits**:
- Confidence in code quality
- Regression prevention
- Documentation through tests
- Easier refactoring

**Trade-offs**:
- Development time overhead
- Maintenance burden
- Test complexity

**Alternative Considered**: Minimal testing, integration tests only
**Why Rejected**:
- Minimal testing: Too risky for complex algorithms
- Integration only: Hard to isolate issues

### ‚úÖ Chosen: Mock Objects for Testing

**Decision**: Used `mocktail` for creating mock objects in tests.

**Benefits**:
- Isolated unit tests
- Predictable test behavior
- Fast test execution
- Easy to maintain

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional dependency
- Mock maintenance overhead
- Potential mock/real object divergence

**Alternative Considered**: Real objects, no mocking, manual mocks
**Why Rejected**:
- Real objects: Slow, unpredictable tests
- No mocking: Hard to test edge cases
- Manual mocks: Too much boilerplate

## üöÄ Features Cut & Why

### ‚ùå Cut: Real-time Data Streaming

**What**: Live data updates from external APIs or WebSocket connections.
